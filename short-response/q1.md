# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

React is a Javascript library that allows the construction of modular reusable 'components'. Overall it makes things like DOM manipulation and working with HTML a lot simpler as it keeps everything in basically the same file.

# Teacher Feedback

Not just because it keeps everything in the same file but rather because it allows seamless integration of HTML and JS together.
